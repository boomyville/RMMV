# Exp Rate Modifcation

Simple plugin that allows the developer to state how EXP is calculated in an SRPG Battle
By default, SRPG_Core.js gives the developer two plugin parameters: Non-Kill Battle EXP rate and Actor EXP Rate
This plugin extends this by allowing EXP to be divided amongst AoE targets and to incorporate unit's levels into EXP calculations
